   <description url="https://github.com/ge-high-assurance/VERDICT/blob/master/tools/README.md">
The VERDICT feature consists of a VERDICT plugin for OSATE and a set
of VERDICT back-end programs invoked by the plugin.  The plugin has
two ways to call the back-end programs; it can run an executable jar
(verdict-bundle-app-&lt;VERSION&gt;-capsule.jar) in a subprocess or it
can run a Docker image (gehighassurance/verdict) in a temporary
container.
