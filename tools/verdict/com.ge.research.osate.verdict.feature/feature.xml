   <description url="https://github.com/ge-high-assurance/VERDICT/blob/master/tools/README.md">
The VERDICT feature consists of an OSATE plugin and a set of VERDICT
back-end programs invoked by the plugin.  The plugin has two ways to
call the back-end programs; it can run an executable jar
(verdict-bundle-&lt;VERSION&gt;-capsule.jar) in a subprocess or it can
run a Docker image (gehighassurance/verdict) in a temporary container.
