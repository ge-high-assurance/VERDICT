Updates: 5/10/2018, Kit Siu, added severityCalc and supporting measures for ADT
         7/23/2018, Kit Siu, added likelihood calculations (formerly severityCalc)

(**
   The top-level functions for the quantitative analysis of fault trees are as follows.

   - {b probErrorCut} : a function that given a fault tree, computes the
   top-level probability of a fault.

   - {b probErrorCutImp} : a function that given a fault tree, computes
   importance measures.
   
   If cutsets are available, the next two functions can compute probabilities
   and importance metrics without having to recompute them.
   
   - {b probErrorCutC} : a function that given a fault tree and cutsets,
   computes the top-level probability of a fault.

   - {b probErrorCutCImp} : a function that given a fault tree and cutsets,
   computes importance measures.

   These functions compute the likelihood of attack using the cutsets.
   
   - {b likelihoodCut} : a function that given an attack-defense tree and cutsets,
   computes the top-level likelihood of an attack.

   - {b likelihoodCutImp} : a function that given an attack-defense tree and cutsets,
   computes the importance measures.

(** A function to compute the probability of failure using an approximate
    method. The probability of failure is lambda * exposure time, which for
    reasonable values of lamba, exposure time is a good approximation.  Also, the
    assumption is that all events are independent and for sums, I use addition,
    another approximation. Notice that these approximations are conservative, so
    that I always get a probability that is >= the true probability.

    I do not handle the case where the same event appears in the fault tree. To
    deal with that, one has to use the cut set methods, which appear below.

    1-e^(-lambda * exposure time). 

    Also, the assumption is that all events are independent and for sums, I use
    the correct formula. Since I'm assuming independence, I can simplify the
    inclusion/exclusion formula as follows:

    P[Sum E] = 1-P[Pro E'] = 1 - *_{i in 1..n}P[ei']
    = 1 - *_{i in 1..n}(1-P[ei])
