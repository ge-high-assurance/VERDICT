Updates: 9/10/2018, Kit Siu, modified to work with models that includes attack-defense.
         4/17/2019, Heber Herencia-zapana, added functions that call all the library & model checks.

*)

(**
 
Validation checks are provided to assist the end-user in building component
library and models created following the modeling constructs defined for fault
tree and attack-defense tree. Checks include those for the component library
only, for the model only, and for the model relative to the library.

Validation checks for component library only:

   - {b checkLibrary_componentUnique} : A library of components is a list of
   components, such that no two components have the same name.

   - {b checkLibrary_nonEmptyFaults} : All components must support at least one
   fault, otherwise there is nothing to analyze.

   - {b checkLibrary_nonEmptyAttacks} : All components must support at least one
   attack, otherwise there is nothing to analyze.

   - {b checkLibrary_disjointInputFlowsandBasicEvents} : Check that the names
   used for input flows and basic events are disjoint.

   - {b checkLibrary_disjointInputFlowsandAttackEvents} : Check that the names
   used for input flows and attack events are disjoint.

   - {b checkLibrary_listsAreConsistentLengths} : Check that the lists are all
   of consistent lengths.

   - {b checkLibrary_allOutputFaultsHaveFormulas} : All flows have a formula
   defined.

   - {b checkLibrary_faultformulasMakeSense} : Check that the fault formulas
   make sense.

   - {b checkLibrary_attackformulasMakeSense} : Check that the attack formulas
   make sense.

   - {b checkLibrary_defenseformulasMakeSense} : Check that the defense formulas
   make sense.

Validation checks for a model only:

   - {b checkModel_inputFlowUnique} : Check that input flows have exactly 1
   instance connected to them.

   - {b checkModel_instanceNameUnique} : All instance names are disjoint.

Validation checks for a model relative to a library:

   - {b checkModel_validConnections} : The connection information is a list of
   pairs consisting of an input flow and an instance.

   - {b checkModel_cnameInstanceIsDefinedInLibrary} : All c_names correspond to
   actual components in our component library.

   - {b checkModel_exposureOfBasicIsDefinedInLibrary} : Elements of the form (a,
   x) in exposures of an instance make sense.

Functions to run all the validation:

   - {b checkLibrary} : Performs all of the library checks.

   - {b checkModel} : Performs all of the model checks.
