   ATTACK-DEFENSE TREES

   Attack-defense trees are represented with the {i adtree} type and Boolean
   formulas are represented with the {i adexp} type.

(** A defense tree is either: 
    a leaf containing a defense and design rigor OR
    an (n-ary) operator along with a list of defense trees. **)
type 'a dtree = 
  | DLeaf of 'a * int
  | DSUM of 'a dtree list 
  | DPRO of 'a dtree list ;; 

(** An attack-defense tree is either: 
    a leaf containing an attack and likelihood of success OR
    an (n-ary) operator along with a list of attack trees
    a combination operator along with a tuple of attack trees and defense trees. **)
type 'a adtree =
