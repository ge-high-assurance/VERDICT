// to handle causingComponent - if based on properties of comp1 we need encryption on link1
// then we would have CapeccType-Encryption on comp1 and CapeccType-Encryption on link1
// and queries would figure out how to write it out

// suppose a component has 2 external links that both need to be encrypted - how would we handle that?
