DAL (note "Design Assurance Level") is a type of int [0,9]. // default value is 0 indicating that the implementation property is false
ComponentType is a class, must be one of {Software, Hardware, Hybrid, Human, SwHwHybrid, SwHumanHybrid, HwHumanHybrid}.
Pedigree is a class, must be one of {InternallyDeveloped, COTS, Sourced}.

Thing (alias "super class of everything") is a class
	described by componentType with a single value of type ComponentType.

Person is a type of Thing.
componentType of Person must be one of {Human}. 

// As (implementation) property may have a DAL, we need to define a Property class instead of just having it as a string
ImplProperty is a class
	described by name with a single value of type string
	described by val with a single value of type boolean
	described by dal with a single value of type DAL. 

// In some cases, when a mitigation (an Implementation Property) is set then additional
// new CAPECS may be present. These need to be handled differently as the implementation property 
// (with DAL value) needs to be also viewed like an "implicit property". There are 3 such mitigations:
// physicalAccessControl (applicable to component)
// and deviceAuthentication, encryptedTransmission (applicable to connection).
// The corresponding properties (boolean value) are called XdeviceAuthentication, XphysicalAccessControl
// and XencryptedTransmission.
